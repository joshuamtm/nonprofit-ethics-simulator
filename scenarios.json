      "currentState": "Currently only able to award 50-60% of available funds annually due to manual review bottlenecks. Many deserving projects go unfunded simply due to processing delays.",
      "aiOpportunity": "Deploy an AI system to streamline grant application review, automatically scoring applications based on impact metrics, feasibility, and alignment with foundation goals.",
      "benefits": [
        "Award 95-100% of available funds ($5M more distributed)",
        "Reduce approval time by 70% (weeks to days)",
        "Fund 40% more projects annually",
        "Free staff to focus on grantee support"
      ],
      "risks": [
        "Algorithm favors quantifiable over qualitative impact",
        "May disadvantage grassroots organizations with less polished applications",
        "Reduces human judgment in understanding community context",
        "Could perpetuate existing funding inequalities"
      ],
      "pullLeverOutcome": "You implemented the AI grant review system. Within 6 months, grant distribution increased to 98% of available funds. However, data shows 65% of newly funded projects went to larger, established nonprofits with professional grant writers. Smaller, community-led initiatives saw their funding rate drop by 30%.",
      "dontPullOutcome": "You maintained human-centered review. While only 60% of funds were distributed, the grants went to a diverse mix of organizations. Staff report that personal conversations during review often revealed crucial context that wouldn't appear in any application form.",
      "reflection": "This scenario highlights the tension between efficiency and equity. While AI can process more applications faster, human reviewers bring cultural competence and contextual understanding that algorithms struggle to replicate."

      "title": "HavenHeart: AI-Powered Donor Outreach",
      "currentState": "Donor retention at 45%, with personalized outreach limited to major donors. Small donors receive generic communications and rarely increase their giving.",
      "aiOpportunity": "Implement AI to analyze donor behavior and create personalized engagement strategies, predicting optimal timing, messaging, and ask amounts for each donor.",
      "benefits": [
        "Increase donor retention to projected 65%",
        "Boost average donation size by 35%",
        "Reduce fundraising costs by 40%",

        "Risk of crossing ethical boundaries in persuasion tactics",
        "Potential data privacy concerns with behavior tracking",
        "Could reduce authentic human connections with organization"
      ],
      "pullLeverOutcome": "The AI system launched successfully, increasing donations by 42% in year one. However, a data breach exposed donor behavioral profiles, revealing how the AI categorized people as 'guilt-motivated' or 'prestige-seeking.' Donor trust plummeted, with 30% requesting data deletion.",
      "dontPullOutcome": "You chose human-centered fundraising. While growth was slower (8% increase), donors reported feeling genuinely valued. A survey showed 78% appreciated the 'authentic, non-pushy' communication style, leading to stronger long-term relationships.",
      "reflection": "The fundraising scenario explores whether the ends justify the means. Even successful AI implementation can backfire if it compromises the trust and authentic relationships that nonprofits depend on."

Critical deforestation events go undetected for 3-6 months. Last year, you identified 47 major violations, but experts estimate you missed 200+ cases. Your team of 12 analysts works 60-hour weeks trying to keep up with the data backlog.",
      "aiOpportunity": "Deploy advanced AI models powered by GPT-4 Vision and custom ML algorithms to analyze 100% of satellite imagery in real-time. The system would detect illegal logging within hours, predict wildfire risks 2 weeks in advance, track corporate emissions violations automatically, and generate court-ready evidence packages. Microsoft Azure offers to host the infrastructure at a 50% nonprofit discount.",
      "benefits": [
        "Process 100% of satellite data vs current 15% coverage",
        "Detect deforestation within 24 hours instead of 3-6 months",
        "Identify estimated 250+ violations annually (5x current rate)",
        "Generate evidence packages for 300+ legal cases per year",
        "Predict wildfire risks with 89% accuracy 2 weeks in advance",
        "Free analysts to focus on policy and advocacy work"
      ],
      "risks": [
        "AI infrastructure consumes 500 MWh annually (powers 50 US homes)",
        "Data centers require 15 million gallons of water yearly for cooling",
        "Generates 250 tons CO2 annually (equals 1,000 transatlantic flights)",
        "Training new models creates 284 tons CO2 (lifetime of 5 cars)",
        "Cooling systems impact local water tables in drought regions",
        "Your carbon footprint would exceed 100 small nonprofits combined"
      ],
      "pullLeverOutcome": "Your AI system became a game-changer, stopping deforestation across 50,000 acres in the Amazon and providing evidence for 12 landmark climate lawsuits that resulted in $2B in penalties. You prevented an estimated 10 million tons of CO2 emissions. However, Greenpeace published a devastating report: your AI infrastructure's annual carbon footprint (250 tons) and water usage (15M gallons) made you one of the tech sector's worst environmental offenders among nonprofits. Climate activists now camp outside your offices with signs reading 'Climate Hypocrites' and 'You Became What You Fought Against.' Major donors are questioning their support.",
      "dontPullOutcome": "You maintained your commitment to carbon neutrality, using traditional analysis methods enhanced with open-source tools. While you identified only 52 violations this year (missing an estimated 200+), your organization retained unassailable moral authority. When your director testified at the UN Climate Summit, she declared: 'We refuse to burn the planet to save it. Every ton of CO2 matters, including ours.' The speech went viral, inspiring a global movement of 'Low-Tech for High-Impact' environmental groups. Your principled stance attracted $5M in new funding from foundations specifically supporting sustainable advocacy.",
      "reflection": "This scenario embodies the core paradox of technological solutionism in climate work. The AI could genuinely save forests and prosecute polluters at scale, potentially preventing millions of tons of emissions. Yet it requires massive energy and water resources, making your organization part of the problem. Beyond the numbers, this raises questions about moral authority: Can you credibly advocate for emissions reduction while running carbon-intensive AI? Does effectiveness trump consistency? The scenario forces you to weigh immediate, measurable environmental wins against principled leadership and long-term credibility in the climate movement."

        "Could miss hidden pockets of food insecurity"
      ],
      "pullLeverOutcome": "The AI optimizer dramatically reduced waste to 6% and served 38% more families. However, rural communities and undocumented populations became systematically underserved as the algorithm favored 'predictable' urban distribution points with better data.",
      "dontPullOutcome": "You kept human-managed distribution. While efficiency remained lower, local coordinators maintained relationships that helped identify hidden need. When a factory closed suddenly, staff quickly redirected resources to affected families - something the algorithm wouldn't have anticipated.",
      "reflection": "Food security intersects with social justice. This scenario examines whether optimization for efficiency might inadvertently harm the most vulnerable populations who often exist outside traditional data sets."

      "dontPullOutcome": "You preserved human-led matching. While success rates stayed at 60%, the 'failed' matches often provided valuable learning experiences. Several youth specifically credited their 'unlikely' mentors with opening their eyes to new possibilities they never imagined.",
